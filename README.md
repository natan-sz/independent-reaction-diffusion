This is the repository for my reaction diffusion simulation code in C++ and Python.

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of different convolution methods, C++ vs Python and CPU vs GPU calculation using Turing Pattern Simulations as a benchmark.

The paper for this project can be found in the root repo under independent_study.pdf
